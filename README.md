# Head First Design Patterns (2nd Edition) - Code Examples

This repository contains code implementations of design patterns from the book **"Head First Design Patterns (2nd Edition)"** by **Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson, Bert Bates, and Kathy Sierra**.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- **Learn and apply design patterns**: By working through each pattern, I aim to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented design principles and patterns.
- **Implement examples in multiple languages**: The examples are implemented in both **Java** and **Go**, allowing for a comparison of how design patterns are applied in different programming languages.
- **Document learning process**: This repository serves as a personal reference and documentation of my journey through the book.

## Project Start Date

I started to read book on **October 6, 2024**, as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of design patterns and their practical implementations.

## Structure

The repository is divided into two main directories, one for **Java** implementations and the other for **Go** implementations. Each directory contains subfolders organized by chapter from the book.


## About the Book

**"Head First Design Patterns (2nd Edition)"** is one of the most popular books on design patterns. It uses an engaging, visual format to explain classic object-oriented design patterns in a way that's easy to understand for both beginner and experienced developers.

The book covers various patterns including:
- Strategy
- Observer
- Decorator
- Factory
- Singleton
- Command
- Adapter & Facade
- Template Method
- Iterator & Composite
- State
- Proxy
- Compound Patterns

## Usage

You can browse through the directories to see the implementations of each design pattern for both **Java** and **Go**. Each chapter has its own folder that contains the respective code examples.

## How to Run

### Java
1. Navigate to the relevant chapter directory inside the `java/` folder.
2. Compile and run the Java files using your preferred IDE or command line.

### Go
1. Navigate to the relevant chapter directory inside the `go/` folder.
2. Run the Go files using:
   ```bash
   go run <filename>.go
